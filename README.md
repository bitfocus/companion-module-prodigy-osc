Please bear with me as this is my first attempt at a module for Companion.  This module is designed to communicate with a Prodigy MP or Prodigy MC by Directout Technologies.  In order to communicate with the Prodigy you will need to ensure that you have a OSC license for each unit you wish to enable communicate with.  

Help files and other documentation are being worked on and will be provided as soon as possible.
